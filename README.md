# Productify – A Spotify Chrome Extension

## Inspiration
Founded in 2006, Spotify is now the world’s leading music streaming service with over 570 million active users. Spotify has expanded upon its influence of audio listening by incorporating podcasts and audiobooks in 2019 and 2023, respectively. With a seemingly increased effort to enhance users’ learning and day-to-day life by developing new features, what could be Spotify’s next launch? With their large influence to increase engagement between people and their activities through music, the idea of Productify was born: a Spotify-productivity Chrome extension that allows users to do tasks in timed flows while listening to music.
